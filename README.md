### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome on Julien's GitHub profile.

Here you'll find some of the very first projects I made during a 6 months training with The Hacking Project (in 2022, Rails / React).
All my current professional projects are "private" because of privacy reasons, but feel free to ask an access in case your interested in my coding skills.
